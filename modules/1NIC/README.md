## Introduction

This solution uses an Terraform template to launch a one NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE standalone device in Microsoft Azure. Traffic flows to the BIG-IP VE which then flows to DVWA app server. This is the standard cloud design where the BIG-IP VE instance is running with a dual interface, and both management and data plane traffic is processed on each separate NIC.  

Terraform is beneficial as it allows composing resources a bit differently to account for dependencies into Immutable/Mutable elements. For example, mutable  includes items you would typically frequently change/mutate, such as traditional configs on the BIG-IP. Once the template is deployed, there are certain resources (network infrastructure) that are fixed while others (BIG-IP VMs and configurations) can be changed.

## Version

This template is tested and worked in the following version
Terraform v0.12.25

* provider.azurerm v2.1
* provider.null v2.1
* provider.template v2.1

## Prerequisites

* **Important**: When you configure the admin password for the BIG-IP VE in the template, you cannot use the character **#**.  Additionally, there are a number of other special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See [K2873](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873) for details.
* This template requires a service principal for backend pool service discovery. **Important**: you MUST have "OWNER" priviledge on the SP in order to assign role to the resources in your subscription. See the [Service Principal Setup section](#service-principal-authentication) for details, including required permissions.
* The HA BIG-IP VMs use Azure RBAC role for the failover instead of using Service Prinicipal.
* This deployment will be using the Terraform Azurerm provider to build out all the neccessary Azure objects. Therefore, Azure CLI is required. For installation, please follow this [Microsoft link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-apt?view=azure-cli-latest)
* If this is the first time to deploy the F5 image, the subscription used in this deployment needs to be enabled to programatically deploy. For more information, please refer to [Configure Programatic Deployment](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/working-with-marketplace-images-on-azure-resource-manager/)

## Important configuration notes

* Variables are configured in variables.tf
* Sensitive variables like Azure Subscription and Service Principal are configured in terraform.tfvars
  + Note: Passwords and secrets will be moved to Azure Key Vault in the future
* This template uses Declarative Onboarding (DO) and Application Services 3 (AS3) packages for the initial configuration. As part of the onboarding script, it will download the RPMs automatically. See the [AS3 documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/) and [DO documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/) for details on how to use AS3 and Declarative Onboarding on your BIG-IP VE(s). The [Telemetry Streaming](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/) extension is also downloaded but not configured to point to any remote analytics/consumers. 
* onboard.tpl is the onboarding script which is run by commandToExecute (user data). It will be copied to /var/lib/waagent/CustomData upon bootup. This script is responsible for downloading the neccessary F5 Automation Toolchain RPM files, installing them, and then executing the onboarding REST calls.
* This template uses PayGo BIGIP image for the deployment (as default). If you would like to use BYOL, then these following steps are needed:
1. In the "variables.tf", specify the BYOL image and licenses regkeys.
2. To find available images/versions, use this search example on Azure CLI:

  

``` 
          az vm image list -f BIG-IP --all
  ```

## Installation Example

To run this Terraform template, perform the following steps:

  1. Clone the repo to your favorite location
  2. Modify terraform.tfvars with the required information

  

``` 
      # BIG-IP Environment
      uname     = "azureuser"
      upassword = "Default12345!"

      # Azure Environment
      sp_subscription_id = "xxxxx"
      sp_client_id       = "xxxxx"
      sp_client_secret   = "xxxxx"
      sp_tenant_id       = "xxxxx"
      location           = "West US 2"

      # Prefix for objects being created
      prefix = "mylab123"
  ```

  3. Initialize the directory

  

``` 
      terraform init
  ```

  4. Test the plan and validate errors

  

``` 
      terraform plan
  ```

  5. Finally, apply and deploy

  

``` 
      terraform apply
  ```

  6. When done with everything, don't forget to clean up!

  

``` 
      terraform destroy
  ```

## Configuration Example

The following is an example configuration diagram for this solution deployment. In this scenario, all access to the BIG-IP VE device is direct to the BIG-IP via the management interface. The IP addresses in this example may be different in your implementation.
